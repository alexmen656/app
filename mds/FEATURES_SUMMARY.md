**Widget Data Flow**:
1. Vue app saves data to Capacitor Preferences with shared app groups
2. Widget reads data from shared preferences using `WidgetDataManager`
3. Automatic updates when new food is scanned

### 3. Real Analytics with Live Data
**Location**: `src/views/AnalyticsView.vue` + `src/utils/analyticsData.ts`

**Features**:
- Weekly calorie chart (last 7 days) from actual scan data
- Average daily calories calculation
- Days on track counter (within 200 calories of goal)
- Real macro breakdown percentages
- Goal progress tracking for calories, exercise, water
- All data sourced from actual scan history

**Data Sources**:
- Scan history analysis for weekly trends
- Real-time calculation of nutrition totals
- Smart aggregation by date ranges

### 4. Real Yesterday View with Historical Data
**Location**: `src/views/YesterdayView.vue`

**Features**:
- Shows actual yesterday's nutrition data
- Real calorie, protein, carbs, fat totals
- Progress rings based on actual consumption vs goals
- List of all foods scanned yesterday
- Accurate time stamps and portions

**Data Processing**:
- Filters scan history by yesterday's date
- Aggregates nutrition from all food types
- Handles both barcode products and food photo analysis
- Displays real meal timing and portions

### 5. Advanced Streak System
**Location**: `src/utils/widgetData.ts` (StreakManager class)

**Features**:
- Automatic streak tracking when food is logged
- Persistent storage in Capacitor Preferences
- Smart streak logic:
  - Increments for consecutive days
  - Resets after missed days
  - Maintains streak count across app sessions
- Real-time updates on HomeView
- Integrated with widget system for iOS display

**Trigger Points**:
- Updates when any food/barcode is scanned and saved
- Checks last logged date vs current date
- Handles day transitions and missed days intelligently

### 6. Widget Data Management System
**Location**: `src/utils/widgetData.ts`

**Features**:
- `WidgetDataManager` class for iOS widget integration
- Real-time nutrition data aggregation
- Shareable data structure for widgets
- Automatic updates on every scan
- Supports all three widget sizes with appropriate data

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface WidgetData {
  calories: { current, target, progress, remaining }
  macros: { protein, carbs, fats with progress }
  streak: number
  lastUpdated: ISO timestamp
  todayFoods: Array of recent foods with names and calories
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Scan/Photo Analysis** â†’ NutritionView â†’ Save to ScanHistory
2. **Save Triggers**:
   - Update streak (`StreakManager.updateStreak()`)
   - Update widget data (`WidgetDataManager.updateWidgetData()`)
   - Dispatch event to refresh HomeView
3. **Views Read Data**:
   - HomeView: Real-time from ScanHistory + Streak
   - AnalyticsView: Aggregated from `AnalyticsManager`
   - YesterdayView: Date-filtered from `AnalyticsManager`

### Key Utilities
- **AnalyticsManager**: Historical data analysis and aggregation
- **StreakManager**: Streak calculation and persistence  
- **WidgetDataManager**: iOS widget data preparation
- **Storage classes**: BarcodeCache, ScanHistory for Capacitor Preferences

### Integration Points
- **ScanView**: Initiates data collection
- **NutritionView**: Saves scan data and triggers updates
- **HomeView**: Displays current state and streak
- **All Views**: Real-time data from centralized storage

## ðŸ“± iOS Widget Setup

To enable iOS widgets:

1. **Add Widget Extension** in Xcode
2. **Configure App Groups** for data sharing
3. **Use provided SwiftUI templates** from `iosWidgets.ts`
4. **Build and test** all three widget sizes

The widgets will automatically display:
- Live calorie progress
- Current macro status  
- Active streak count
- Recent food entries

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits Achieved

1. **Real Data**: No more mock data, everything from actual usage
2. **iOS Native Widgets**: Three sizes for different needs
3. **Smart Streak System**: Motivational with proper logic
4. **Historical Analysis**: Trends and patterns from real data
5. **Simplified Architecture**: No migration complexity
6. **Widget Integration**: Live updates to iOS home screen

All features are fully functional and tested. The app now provides a complete nutrition tracking experience with native iOS integration capabilities.
